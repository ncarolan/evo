# E V O

evo is a playground for evolutionary agents in your browser, with world mechanics inspired by the popular web game <a href="https://agar.io">agar.io</a>.

### Here's how it works:

- Agents spawn into a virtual world filled with food pellets and other agents.
- Agents can eat food to grow, and can eat other agents smaller than them.
- Each agent has a "brain" that determines how it behaves. The parameters of an agent's brain are displayed in its color.
- After each epoch, the most successful alive agents reproduce to populate the next epoch.
